# PremierLeagueApp
A simple web app to display the English Premier League table.
It fetches data from [open football](https://github.com/openfootball/football.json) 
and does the maths as well as the sorting to produce the table, which can be compared to the table produced by Google when you search for 'epl table'.

~~At the time of writing this, the web app only displays (position, team name, and points). The options for selecting each season is also 'hard-coded'.~~

~~The aim, however, is to do a little more maths with the data to fill the table with other important details. And make the options for selecting a season less hard-coded i.e. use JavaScript to display the options from an array.~~

The site for this web app can be found [here](https://leaguetable.netlify.app).
